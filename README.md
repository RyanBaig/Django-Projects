# Django Projects
Basically, These are the projects I made using the Django course by [CodeWithHarry](https://youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry).
They are made with Django.

basically, to run/install this, run this:
```bash
pip install django
```
thats all then go to the project you want to use using `cd {PROJECT_NAME}` then run:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
